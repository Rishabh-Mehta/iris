1.Description
-------------
IRIS data set is used to calculate 3-nearest neighbours decision boundaries when class labels are flipped and report its LOOCV error


2. Code Usage
--------------
Python 3 file :iris1NNboundary.py 
Execution : Execute the code ./iris1NNboundary.py  in terminal or it can be executed through Visual studio code IDE

3.Output:
---------
The output will plot 3NN decision boundaries for each of the flipped data sets and give error rate and LOOCV error rate 
Plots : The 4 plots shows how 3NN decision boundaries vary when the model is trained with flipped labels 
        

Output is stored in ./MEHTA_662520990/MEHTA_662520990-iris.pdf and code is placed under ./MEHTA_662520990/code/ directory
